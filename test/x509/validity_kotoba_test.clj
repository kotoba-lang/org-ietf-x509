;; `kotoba/x509/validity.kotoba` against `x509.core`.
;;
;; Held against the same two certificates the existing suite uses -- real
;; DER from OpenSSL, a self-signed P-256 root and the timestamping leaf it
;; issued -- so a misreading here cannot agree with a miswriting.
;;
;; ## Two findings
;;
;;   * `the-caller-s-instant-is-never-normalised` -- `valid-at?`'s docstring
;;     justifies its byte comparison: "`asn1/time-value` normalises BOTH to
;;     `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`". Both means `not-before` and `not-after`. The
;;     third operand is the caller's and nothing normalises it or checks
;;     that it is in that form, so an instant written with an offset makes
;;     an expired certificate valid, and one written the way
;;     `Date.prototype.toISOString()` writes it makes a valid certificate
;;     not yet valid.
;;
;;   * `a-signature-verifies-without-the-signer-being-a-ca` --
;;     `verify-signature` reasons about the chain and checks the issuer
;;     NAME. It reads five fields of the issuer and neither
;;     `basicConstraints` nor `keyUsage` is among them, though §6.1.4 (k)
;;     and (n) require both and this library has `ca?` and `key-usage`
;;     sitting beside it.
;;
;; The fix for the first is not a calendar: byte order IS the right
;; comparison inside the normalised form, so the guest REQUIRES the form
;; and refuses anything else. `an-instant-outside-the-form-is-refused-
;; rather-than-compared` is the whole argument in one test.
