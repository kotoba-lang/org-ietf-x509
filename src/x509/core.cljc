  "[RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280.html) certificate parsing —
  the subset a signature verifier actually needs, portable `.cljc`.

  ## What this is for, and the line it will not cross

  Enough of a certificate to answer: whose key is this, what is it allowed to
  sign, over what period, and does its issuer's key vouch for it. That is what
  CMS, RFC 3161 and PAdES need.

  What it is **not** is a path validation engine, and the gap is deliberate
  rather than pending. Full RFC 5280 §6 validation includes name constraints,
  policy mapping, CRL and OCSP freshness — and every one of those turns on
  fetching something. A library that fetched would hand every caller an SSRF
  surface driven by attacker-supplied certificate contents, which is the reason
  `org-w3-vc-data-integrity` requires an injected `:resolve-key` rather than
  resolving `did:web` itself. So: `verify-signature` takes the issuer's parsed
  certificate as an argument and an injected `verify-fn`, and `valid-at?` takes
  the time. Nothing here reaches out, and nothing here holds a key.

  ## The three refusals that are not optional

  1. **The outer `signatureAlgorithm` must equal `tbsCertificate.signature`**
     (§4.1.1.2). They are the same fact written twice, and only the inner one is
     covered by the signature. A verifier that reads the outer one and verifies
     with the inner — or reports the outer to a human — can be shown a
     certificate that says one algorithm and is checked as another.

  2. **An unrecognised CRITICAL extension makes the certificate unusable**
     (§4.2). `critical` means the issuer said \"reject this certificate if you do
     not understand this\". Parsing on and ignoring it inverts the one bit whose
     entire purpose is to be un-ignorable. `unhandled-critical-extensions`
     reports them and `usable?` refuses.

  3. **A `BasicConstraints` `cA` of false means it may not sign certificates**,
     and an absent extension is not permission. `ca?` answers false for both, so
     a caller cannot read \"no opinion\" as \"allowed\"."
